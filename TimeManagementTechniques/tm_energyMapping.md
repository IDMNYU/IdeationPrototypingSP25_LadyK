# Time Management: Energy Mapping

## Mapping Your Energy

### Introduction

This is a different type of Time Management. Here, you aren't managing time. Instead you are mappining your energy.

This is another two week time management. The first week is spent studing and observing. The second week is spent putting a plan of action in place.

### Week 1: 

For 2-3 days that are week/work days (ie, not a rest day), track your energy level _throughout_ the day. 

* What's it like when you first get up?
* What's is like in the morning?
* Do you notice any dips or increases in energy?
* What happens before lunch?
* What happens after lunch?
* Do you notice any dips or increases in energy?
* What happens around dinner time?
* What happens in the evening after dinner?
* What happens later at night?
* What happens after midnight?
* What do you notice when you go to bed?
