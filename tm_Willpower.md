# Time Management: Growing Your Willpower

## Willpower

### Introduction

*Week 1*

1. Take some time to reflect on something that you'd really like/need/want to do, but some how, you never seem to quite get there.

2. Now, when you try to do the task, notice what is going on, when you fail or give in. Are there particular circumstances or contexts? What is going on during these moments. Note these.

3. What is the thing you are trying for? What is something that tempts you to lose your willpower to do this thing? What is your ultimate goal or end goal with relation to the thing you are trying? Write it out.


### Some examples:

"I will manage my schedule. I won't scroll on social media. I want to spend my free time today out with my friends."

"I will study. I won't slack off. I want to be the first in my family to get a medical degree."

"I will eat salads. I won't eat carbs. I want to not fall asleep in the afternoon."

"I will do yoga in the morning. I won't sleep in or rush off to work. I want to be less anxious and improve my physical health"



### Process Site Post: Post a reflection about what happens when you give in - what is the context and circumstance? What is going on during those moments? Post outlining your "I will ...., I won't.....and I want...." detailing all three.
