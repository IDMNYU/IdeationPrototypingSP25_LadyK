### DM-UY 1143 Ideation and Prototyping


# [Mind Maps](MindMaps.md)


## Overview
Mind Maps are a method of exploring an idea visually. The goal is to uncover what is happening subconsciously in your mind and to further articulate your thinking further. Think of this as a way to explore your thoughts. 

## Key things that are critical to keep in mind

* There is NO JUDGEMENT or CRITIC while doing this exercise. Let everything flow, including the good, the bad, the ugly, the humorous. Just put it down. Just because it's a thought doesn't mean one has to commit to it. Yet, does it bring anything else to mind?

* For example: If you put "music" down, what does that mean to you? Don't just stop at music. Pretend your communicating to someone from a very far off planet and a completely different culture. Tell us about this thing with reference to yourself. What is it about music? Does it remind you of lullabies as a child? Ceremonial music from your heritage? Does it have a secret meaning between you and your friend? Is it something your grandmother played? Is it something that drives your parents mad? What kind of music? Do you play music? What do you love to play? Where do you listen to music? What memories do you have associated with music? What does music mean to you? Did you do a dance routine to this music? Oh? What kind of dance? What is it about dance? etc etc.


* Thoroughly explore each entry and build/branch off of it. Reserve judgement/evaluation for later. Each mind map should be DENSE, DIVERSE and THOROUGH.

* You might not be able to do this in one sitting. Take a break! Come back to it! ADD TO IT LATER! Breaks are important. Don't put so much pressure on yourself to do it one sitting. Brains don't work like that.

## Methods

There are many different techniques to do a mind map. Some are web-like, some are lists, some just words. It's not complete sentences. Just thoughts. The goal is to get your mind flowing and to document the process. Ultimately, one should have some realizations or revelations by the end. What are those realizations? Talk about this in your reflection summary.

Do you notice that you are going to the end of the page? Cool! But, is it stopping you? Not Cool. Don't let the edge of the page subtly influence you. Be aware of this. Tack on another paper and keep going! Don't let the edge of the page be your ending point.

## Conclusion

* Always take a picture, scan and upload the image to your process site. Put it under the heading as directed. Make sure the image is legible. Make sure the image is uploaded to the server.

* Always include a refection. I'm not looking for a play-by-play review. 
	- I'm looking to understand what the process was like for you. 
	- What did you realize? Tell me about it!
	- Where are you stuck? Tell me about it!
	- How do you want to move forward? Tell me about it!
	- Where are you at, at this very moment? Tell me about it!
