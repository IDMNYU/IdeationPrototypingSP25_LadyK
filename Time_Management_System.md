### Part 1: Experiment with various systems:

During weeks 2-11, Do the prescribed Time Management Systems (The one that has been discussed in class) during a 2-3 days of your week. The specific Time Management System for the week will be discussed on Wednesdays in class. Document the method and post it to your Process Site under "time management system". 

Take notes on the following. We will discuss these in class:

* How you approached it: When did you set it up for? How did your structure it? 

* Did your execution go as planned? Did you have trouble with the system? Did you have trouble keeping the system? If so, why?

* What else did you notice? What changes occurred.

* What would another attempt or iteration include? What would you change to be more successful? Will you try this iteration? 

* Will you use this method again? How much or how frequently or when would you use this?

* When directed: Create a refined hybrid system or develop a new system that helps you be most successful. What is this system? Discuss it and why you are going to utilize this moving forward?
