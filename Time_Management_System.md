### DM-UY 1143 Ideation and Prototyping


## Time Management System

### Introduction

Throughout the semester, we will discuss and try various time management techniques. We will approach time management, task management and energy management from a variety of perspectives.

Please do/try the assigned time management structure for the week. These will be introduced on Wednesday (for the most part). You are required to try the particular technique 2-3 days (your busy days) until the following Wednesday (when a new technique or step will be dicussed.) Post your reflections to your Process site, by the following Saturday by 9am.

Consider the points below to help you in your reflection/discussion:

* How you approached it: When did you set it up for? How did your structure it? 

* Did your execution go as planned? Did you have trouble with the system? Did you have trouble keeping the system? If so, why?

* What else did you notice? What changes occurred.

* What would another attempt or iteration include? What would you change to be more successful? Will you try this iteration? 

* Will you use this method again? How much or how frequently or when would you use this?


### Time Management Techniques  Discussed This Semester

* [Actionable Tasks](TimeManagementTechniques/tm_actionableTask.md)

* Time Blocking/Box + Stephen Covey's time management matrix

* Personal Kanban 

* Time Inventory/Audit 2 wks + Unscheduled Time

* Pomodoro Technique

* Instead of managing time, manage your energy. Track your energy over 1 week. Then structure your next 3 days time based around when your energy is best, for each respective task. 

* Time Surfing (bonus)

### Part 2: Practice Week 12-15

In last and remainging weeks of the semester, create a refined hybrid system or develop a new system that helps you be most successful. What is this system? Discuss it and why you are going to utilize this moving forward? 

Put your refined system into practice. Document your successes and failures to your process blog under time management systems. By week 13, post final reflections and next steps.
