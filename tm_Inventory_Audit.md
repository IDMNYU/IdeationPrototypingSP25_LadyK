# Time Management: Time Inventory/Audit

## Time Inventory/Audit

### Introduction

This is a two week time management exercise. There is NO judgement here. It's a critical look at how you actually spend your time. Where does your time goes? Let's find it!

*Week 1*

The first week, take an inventory of your time, in 20-30 minute increments, noting how you spent the time. This is not about what you'd like to do, or should do. This is documenting what you _actually did_. Record small increments of time. Not minute. Not vast spans. 

Write this down somewhere (phone, notebook, etc) and post images to your Process site. Post a reflection. What did you notice about your intentions versus reality? What are other things that you were made aware of?


*Week 2*
