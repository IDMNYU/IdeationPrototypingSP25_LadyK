# [Future Project](Future.md) Weekly Brief

### Semester Week 10 | Week 3: 

1. Pick/Identify 2-3 other aspects that are going on in your world that are separate from your idea. Do brainstorming & mindmapping, to explore not only what they are, but HOW they work. What other things were you interested in, but _just_ couldn't fit into your core idea? This is the time to put them in play. Examples include:

- economic system

- weather/landscape

- employment/work

- belief systems/religion

- transportation

- Health care

- Family

- Domestic systems

- Food

- government

- science


2. Identify 2-3 resources to help you elaborate on your *Core Idea/Final Theme*. These resources should be diverse in content with relation to one another. Idenitify them and tell us what they are about and how they might be useful.

3. Articulate your Assumptions for this world. Explore and elaborate your idea with the 5 Whys. Upload evidence of these two to your site and write a short reflection.

4. Start developing a Concept Map OR moodboard (this depends on how far you are. People further along - concept map. People struggling with choosing and getting off the ground - mood board.)

Coming up: Research on your aspects within your, diving deeper into your world - "down to street level" and the people.

### Semester Week 9 | Week 2: Sorted Cards, Brainstorming, research

1. Revisit your cards again. Make sure your Theme cards are specific, and that your descriptor cards (for each theme) are broad with consideration to that theme. 

	Some ways to do this:
		- Use the "How Might We", "What if", "How might" to explore your theme in play in your world. Mind map about it. This should help you generate diverse descriptors if you are thinking about your theme within your WORLD
		- Perhaps you have a theme and simply brainstorm/brain dump all the various things associated with that. Identify ones to use for your descriptor cards
		- What are some dreams, hopes, fears and nightmares about our current world? Take those and run with those for a bit. What would the world be like if one of those were in play? What would the world's complexities be?

Remember the goal of creating a world that is fundamentally different than out current world. Explore alternate values and assumptions. You are highly encouraged to take your ideas quite far out, including in time.

2. Once you have your cards, pick a theme and some random descriptor and enabler cards. Can you cook these up into an idea? Does the remix of these cards generate ideas? Perhaps you realize other cards that need to be created. If so, add them to the pile.

3. Cook up several ideas. Tell us about each one. Which is your favorite? Don't have a favorite? Then, redesign your cards and do another go at the exercise. The goal is for you to land on something you like!

4. Do a mindmap of your idea, exploring it in greater detail with that world. Tell us at the end, how your thinking has evolved.

5. Going Further: Pick up 2-3 resources that help you develop your idea with a more solid foundation. What do you need to learn about, or how can you deepen your understanding and collect more details and concepts about your idea. Look through those resources. Tell us about the resources and what your findings are and how this could be useful.

Coming up: A concept map, exploring this idea and it's various contexts in your world.


### Semester Week 8 | Week 1: Future Project - Launch

1. Read Speculative Everything (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project, giving it context, as you are developing a speculative future. Do not skip it. Write a brief reflection and post under reflections (if you have not done so).

2. Read over the ENTIRE [Card Sorting Exercise](cardSortingExercise.md). Visualize it. Familiarize your self with it. Bring your questions to class.

3. Brainstorm/mindmap to identify some themes you are interested in. Then, do more mindmapping exploring each of these individually and more deeply. Post your results and articulate where you are at
