# [Future Project](Future.md) Weekly Brief

### Semester Week 8 | Week 1: Future Project - Launch

1. Read Speculative Everything (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project, giving it context, as you are developing a speculative future. Do not skip it. Write a brief reflection and post under reflections (if you have not done so).

2. Read over the ENTIRE [Card Sorting Exercise](cardSortingExercise.md). Visualize it. Familiarize your self with it. Bring your questions to class.

3. Brainstorm/mindmap to identify some themes you are interested in. Then, do more mindmapping exploring each of these individually and more deeply. Post your results and articulate where you are at
